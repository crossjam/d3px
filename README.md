# d3xp: Discogs Datadumps: Derivations, eXtractions, and Processing

An assortment of tools, code, and projects oriented around using the
[Discogs Datadumps][1] as a playground for large(ish) scale data
processing experiments and personal development. The data is real
world (supports [discogs.com](https://discogs.com), quite longitudinal
(spanning 12 years), updated monthly, and of course a bit messy.
